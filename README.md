# ffmpeg basic library

I need play a video and superimpose a generate animations, this is the basic library to draw in a framebuffer the video from a file.

This is a test, if you use and found any bug, please send me the correction for fix.

There are some memory leak when change video play and some freeze condition when change the size.
